- **Top Performer:** Chipsy Cooking Fat with 233% uplift
- **Promo Coverage:** 42.5% average store coverage

**What This Means:**

**Methodology Note:**
Due to the cross-sectional nature of the 7-day snapshot data, promotional effectiveness is measured by comparing stores running promotions to stores not running promotions for the same SKUs during the same period. 

**Critical Insights:**
1. Promotions work - 7.56% average uplift proves effectiveness
2. Chipsy Cooking Fat is your star performer (233% uplift)
3. Room to expand - 42.5% coverage means opportunities exist
**Critical Insight:**
Despite no active promotions, Bidco still captures 7.84% market share. This suggests:
1. Strong brand equity (customers buy without needing discounts)
2. Opportunity cost - Could promotions drive higher volume?
3. Competitive disadvantage - If competitors are promoting and you're not

**Recommendations:**

1. **Expand Coverage of Best Performers**
   - Chipsy Cooking Fat shows 233% uplift - expand to more stores
   - Currently at 42.5% average coverage - target 70%+
   - Prioritize products with proven high uplift

2. **Optimize Discount Depth**
   - Current average: 15.3% discount
   - Test deeper discounts (20-25%) on moderate performers
   - May unlock higher uplift percentages

3. **Strategic Promo Calendar**
   - 67.6% of portfolio on promo is high - consider rotation
   - Avoid training customers to wait for discounts
   - Balance promoted vs full-price selling

### 3. How Are We Priced vs Competition?

**Answer: Overall discount-positioned, but with significant category variation.**

**Overall Price Positioning:**
- **Price Index:** 0.825 (Bidco prices ~18% below competitor average)
- **Portfolio Mix:** 
  - 63.4% of SKUs are discount-priced (below market)
  - 31.7% are premium-priced (above market)
  - 4.9% at market parity

**What This Means:**
This is a predominantly a value brand, undercutting competitors on most products. However, nearly a third of the portfolio commands premium pricing.

**Category-Level Breakdown:**

| Category | Price Index | Position | Insight |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Puffed Snacks | 1.664 | **PREMIUM** | Charging 66% above market - unique offering or overpriced? |
| Cooking Fats | 1.386 | **PREMIUM** | 39% above market |
| Noodles | 1.243 | **PREMIUM** | 24% above market |
| Non-Carbonated Drinks | 0.925 | **AT MARKET** | Competitive parity |
| Margarine | 0.876 | **DISCOUNT** | 12% below market |

| Detergent Powder | 0.532 | **DISCOUNT** | 47% below market |
| Breakfast Cereals | 0.422 | **DEEP DISCOUNT** | 58% below market |

**Critical Insights:**

1. **Margin Opportunity (Detergent Powder)**
   - You're 47% cheaper than competitors
   - This is excessive discounting - unlikely to be necessary
   - **Action:** Test 10-15% price increase on Msafi range
   - **Potential Impact:** Could improve margins by 18-28% with minimal volume loss

2. **Premium Justification (Puffed Snacks)**
   - 66% price premium is extreme
   - Either: (a) Unique product with no direct competition, or (b) Overpriced
   - **Action:** Review competitive set - are you truly comparable?
   - **Risk:** If competitors exist, you're vulnerable to substitution

3. **Sweet Spot (Non-Carbonated Drinks)**
   - Priced at market parity (index 0.925)
   - This is ideal positioning - competitive without leaving margin on table
   - **Model:** Replicate this positioning in other categories

**Store-Level Variance:**
- Price positioning varies by store (not uniform)
- Some stores perceive you as premium, others as discount
